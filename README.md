# Introduction
In a survey, it was found that 58% of the population in India would spend money
on an electronic device rather than investing it.What if you could save money
while youâ€™re spending it? Hence, the purpose of developing this application is to
enable users to save money with every transaction. Our mission is to look after
the financial best interests of the up-and-coming, beginning with the empower-
ing step of micro-investing. This application aims to provide financial security
to the users with the help of spare changes that they neglect and thus, every
purchase can become an investment with Round-Ups. It will directly impact
the teenagers who cannot control their expenditure. Through this, we aim to
promote financial literacy by emphasizing the importance of saving money and
investing it early.

# Project Description
## Motivation
When it comes to savings and investment as a teenager with an inconsistent
source of income, micro-investing turns out to be a viable option. A micro-
investing platform is an application that allows users to regularly save small
sums of money. Micro-investing platforms aim to remove traditional barriers to
investing, such as brokerage account minimums, and encourage people to invest
even if they have limited incomes and assets.

## Use Case

Gullak finds use in all phases of life. Our product is useful to teenagers in schools
and colleges with limited income as well as to working professionals with fixed
salaries. Through our application, users can save money on any payment that
is done online. Along with this, users can refer our blog page for content on
financial educational.
